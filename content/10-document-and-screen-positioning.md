Maintain Ergonomic Awareness Even When You Feel Fine. Even if you're not experiencing pain today and your setup feels "good enough," small ergonomic improvements can prevent future discomfort and support long-term health. Ergonomics isn't just about fixing problems—it's about staying ahead of them.

Here are best practices tailored for someone who feels fine now but wants to stay that way:

- **Check Your Posture Periodically:**

  - Sit upright with shoulders relaxed, not hunched
  - Keep ears aligned with shoulders—not jutting forward
  - Use lumbar support to maintain the spine's natural curve

- **Micro-Adjustments Matter:**

  - Slightly tweak monitor height or chair angle every few weeks
  - Reassess keyboard/mouse placement to avoid creeping strain
  - Try different sitting positions throughout the day to stay dynamic

- **Build Movement Into Your Routine:**

  - Stand up and stretch for 1–2 minutes every 30–60 minutes
  - Walk around during calls or meetings when possible
  - Use apps or reminders to prompt movement breaks

- **Stay Ahead of Eye Strain:**

  - Follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds
  - Adjust screen brightness and contrast to match ambient lighting
  - Keep screens clean and reduce glare with filters or repositioning

- **Future-Proof Your Setup:**
  - Consider investing in a sit-stand desk or ergonomic accessories
  - Keep a log of how your body feels at the end of each day
  - Schedule a quarterly self-check or ergonomic assessment

**Why It Matters:**
Ergonomic issues often develop slowly—by the time pain appears, habits are harder to change. Staying proactive helps you avoid that trap and keeps your body resilient.
