No Pain? Still Protect Your Posture. Ergonomic discomfort often creeps in slowly. Building healthy habits today helps prevent injury and keeps drivers productive, pain-free, and safe long term.

Even if you feel good now, check that your **seat is adjusted to your body's natural posture**, your **knees and hips are level or slightly open**, and your **arms are relaxed while steering**.

- Allow **25–30 cm (10–12 in.)** between your chest and steering wheel for safety and movement (Recommendation 2).
- Confirm your **steering column and dashboard leave enough room for your legs** during movement (Recommendation 3).
- **Your seat should feel comfortable** (Recommendation 4)—if you feel off-balance, adjust the tilt or lumbar area.
- Ensure **headroom clearance** (Recommendation 5) and that your seat base is not too long (Recommendation 6).
- Keep your **headrest within 10 cm (4 in.) of your head** and aligned with the top of your ears (Recommendations 7 & 8).
- **Never ignore pain** (Recommendation 1)—address it early to avoid escalation.
- Take **microbreaks every 1–2 hours**, do a few stretches outside the vehicle, and hydrate regularly—even on short shifts.
