# ROADMAP

- [x] Compile all ergonomics recommendations into `recommendations`
- [x] Process remaining modules
- [x] Extract ergonomics resources from `/recommendations` into `/resources` and assign numeric IDs
- [x] Standardize structure:
  - Numbered modules in `/discover`
  - Renumbered recommendations in `recommendations`
  - Resources mapped in `/resources`
- [x] Migrate existing modules into new structure
- [x] Restructure topics and modules around questions (won't look much different)
- [x] Document structure: modules → topics → flows (produce folder tree)
- [x] Audit the new data tables
- [x] Setup "Doors" section
  - [x] in same format as existing data tables, make "onboarding-questions", "onboarding-options" and map the options a user selects to what modules they will be shown/hidden/recommended. Stick to the original data-tables structure but add/remove columns to support the difference in flow between the onboarding questions and the discover model questions - consider all the files from `/onboarding`
- [ ] Translate structure into Firebase data tables
- [ ] put in a format for people who cna only use microsoft word can read
- [ ] Put into GitHub and share
