Even if you are not currently experiencing pain or discomfort, always remember that general ergonomic strategies remain available to promote long-term health and workplace comfort.

1. **Maintain Proper Distance** — Keep 25–30 cm (10–12 in.) between your chest and steering wheel for safety and comfort.

2. **Adjust Your Seat** — Ensure your hips are level with or slightly higher than your knees, with full thigh support.

3. **Position Your Headrest** — Keep it less than 10 cm (4 in.) from your head, aligned with the top of your ears.

4. **Take Regular Breaks** — Walk, stretch, or stand every 2–3 hours to restore circulation and prevent fatigue.
