2. **Follow Core Ergonomic Practices** — Keep frequently used items within easy reach, adjust postures when possible, and incorporate regular breaks and stretching to prevent fatigue and discomfort.

3. **Stay Mindful of Your Body** — Continuously check in with yourself to recognize early signs of discomfort, preventing minor aches from developing into more serious concerns.

4. **Check back in SPHERE if your role changes** or you start to experience any changes.
