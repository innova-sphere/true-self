245	Move to Relax	Move your body, lift your mood—exercise for relaxation and lasting well-being.	Physical relaxation is essential for managing stress and improving overall well-being. Regular exercise helps lower stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline while boosting endorphins, the body's natural mood enhancers. Simple activities like daily walks, joining a gym, participating in team sports, or working with a personal trainer can make movement enjoyable and sustainable. These practices not only support physical health but also promote mental clarity and emotional balance.			gs://innovamobile-e85d9.appspot.com/Recommendation Videos - with captions/145_Recommendation_v01 (My Focus).mp4	gs://innovamobile-e85d9.appspot.com/recVideoImages/004.png		My Focus

Meaningful relationships offer emotional support, a sense of belonging, and shared experiences that enhance well-being and reduce stress. Strengthening current relationships through active communication, empathy, and shared activities deepens connection and trust.

250	Improve Access to Printed Text with Vision Support Tools	Use magnifiers for enhanced visibility or convert text into accessible formats like braille, digital content, or spoken output using OCR technology.	For individuals with limited vision, accessing non-digital (printed) text can be challenging—but several adaptive tools can help: 1. When magnification is effective, explore a variety of magnifier options. o Handheld magnifiers are great for short-term or spot reading tasks like menus, labels, or signatures. These compact tools come in many sizes, with or without handles, and some offer digital enhancements like adjustable zoom or built-in lighting. o For extended reading sessions, such as reviewing long documents, stand magnifiers may be more suitable. They rest on the page and don't require constant holding, providing a more stable and comfortable reading experience. 2. When magnification isn't sufficient, other formats and technologies may be needed: o Offer printed information in braille for those who read tactilely. o Digital formats allow access through screen readers or magnification software. o Tools using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) can scan printed text using a digital camera or scanner and convert it into spoken or digital text. This is ideal for individuals who cannot view print or who understand better through verbal delivery.			gs://innovamobile-e85d9.appspot.com/Recommendation Videos - with captions/150_Recommendation_v01 (My Habits).mp7	gs://innovamobile-e85d9.appspot.com/recVideoImages/002.png		My Habits
