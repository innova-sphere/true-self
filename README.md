### Data Flow Process

#### Phase 1: Onboarding System

1. **Account Registration**: User provides personal information and authentication
2. **Work Classification**: User answers 17 onboarding questions to determine work environment type
3. **Module Assignment**: System determines which of the 13 discovery modules are relevant based on work type

#### Phase 2: Discovery System

1. **Module Selection**: User chooses from available specialized workplace modules (filtered by work type)
2. **Dynamic Assessment**: System presents contextual questions from the 79-question pool based on selected module
3. **Conditional Logic**: Follow-up questions appear based on previous answers and prerequisite relationships
4. **Response Collection**: User selections are captured from 208 available answer options
5. **Recommendation Engine**: System generates personalized suggestions from 144 recommendation pool
6. **Resource Delivery**: External implementation tools and guides provided from 148 curated resources

#### Data Relationships

- **Tags System**: 4 main categories (My Space, My Focus, My Balance, My Habits) organize modules, recommendations, and resources
- **Topics System**: 45 organizational headers provide additional content classification and filtering

  // "Add a recommendation for standing desk users about monitor height"

  // Intelligent relationship management
  validateRelationships(): Promise<RelationshipReport>;
  // Automatically detect and resolve content dependencies

  // AI-powered content generation
  generateQuestions(moduleContext: string): Promise<Question[]>;
  // Create contextually relevant assessment questions
}
```
